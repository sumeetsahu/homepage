      "issueDate": "November 20, 2018",
      "assignee": "Adobe Inc.",
      "icon": "🔬",
      "summary": "Invented spatially-adaptive filtering techniques for removing interference patterns from digital images. The patent describes a novel approach where an edge detection system generates context data including distance from edges, color similarity, and luminance data to construct adaptive filters that effectively remove interference patterns while preserving image quality.",
